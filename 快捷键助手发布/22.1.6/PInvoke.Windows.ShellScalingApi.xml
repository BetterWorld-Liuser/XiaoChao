            Tip: If your app is <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_DPI_UNAWARE"/>, there is no need to set any value in the application manifest.
            <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_DPI_UNAWARE"/> is the default value for apps unless another value is specified. Also, in previous versions of Windows,
            there was no setting for <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE"/>. Apps were either DPI unaware or DPI aware.
            Legacy applications that were classified as DPI aware before Windows 8.1 are considered to have a PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS setting of <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_SYSTEM_DPI_AWARE"/>
            in current versions of Windows.
            </para>
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Users have the ability to set the DPI scale factor on their displays independent of each other.
            Some legacy applications are not able to adjust their scaling for multiple DPI settings.
            In order for users to use these applications without content appearing too large or small on displays, Windows can apply DPI virtualization to an application,
            causing it to be automatically be scaled by the system to match the DPI of the current display.
            The PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS value indicates what level of scaling your application handles on its own and how much is provided by Windows.
            Keep in mind that applications scaled by the system may appear blurry and will read virtualized data about the monitor to maintain compatibility.
            </para>
            The DPI awareness for an application should be set through the application manifest so that it is determined before any actions are taken
            which depend on the DPI of the system. Alternatively, you can set the DPI awareness using SetProcessDpiAwareness, but if you do so,
            you need to make sure to set it before taking any actions dependent on the system DPI. Once you set the DPI awareness for a process, it cannot be changed.
            <para>
            </para>
            <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_DPI_UNAWARE"/> and <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_SYSTEM_DPI_AWARE"/> apps do not need to respond to the Window Message WM_DPICHANGED
            and are not expected to handle changes in DPI. The system will automatically scale these types of apps up or down as necessary when the DPI changes.
            <see cref="F:PInvoke.PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS.PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE"/> apps are responsible for recognizing and responding to changes in DPI, signaled by WM_DPICHANGED.
            These will not be scaled by the system. If an app of this type does not resize the window and its content,
            it will appear to grow or shrink by the relative DPI changes as the window is moved from one display
            to the another with a different DPI setting.
            <para>
            In previous versions of Windows, there was no setting for PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE. Apps were either DPI unaware or DPI aware.
            Legacy applications that were classified as DPI aware before Windows 8.1 are considered to have a PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS setting of PROCESS_SYSTEM_DPI_AWARE in current versions of Windows.
            </para>
            <para>
            Unlike the other awareness values, PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE should adapt to the display that it is on.
            This means that it is always rendered natively and is never scaled by the system.
            The responsibility is on the app to adjust the scale factor when receiving the WM_DPICHANGED message.
            Part of this message includes a suggested rect for the window.
            This suggestion is the current window scaled from the old DPI value to the new DPI value.
            </para>
            <para>
            Because of DPI virtualization, if one application queries another with a different awareness level for DPI-dependent information,
            the system will automatically scale values to match the awareness level of the caller.
            One example of this is if you call GetWindowRect and pass in a window created by another application. Using the situation described above,
            assume that a PROCESS_DPI_UNAWARE app created a 500 by 500 window on display C.
            If you query for the window rect from a different application, the size of the rect will vary based upon the DPI awareness of your app:
            </para>
            <list>
            <item>PROCESS_DPI_UNAWARE: You will get a 500 by 500 rect because the system will assume a DPI of 96 and automatically scale the actual rect down by a factor of 3.</item>
            <item>PROCESS_SYSTEM_DPI_AWARE: You will get a 1000 by 1000 rect because the system will assume a DPI of 192 and automatically scale the actual rect down by a factor of 3/2.</item>
            <item>PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE: You will get a 1500 by 1500 rect because the system will use the actual DPI of the display and not do any scaling behind the scenes.</item>
            </list>
